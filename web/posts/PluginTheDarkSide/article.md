## I used plugins

I made mistakes on my Vim way. In my early days with my Text Eddie-tor, like lot of Vimer, I used plugins. LOT of plugins. Plugins are the dark side of the force.

<em>"Does the dark side be the stronger ? No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive."</em> Master Yoda to Luke Skywalker.

Plugins will give you unlimited power but, you'll lose some Vim advantages. <strong>You'll need your plugins to use Vim</strong>. You'll need NERDTreePlugin to surf your projects. You'll need Fugitive cause "It's faster than press Ctrl + Tab". Vim will become a <strong>monster</strong> thing that take 10 minutes to install all plugins with the Plug manager, installing and compiling YouCompleteMe and FZF etc. It will take <strong>3 second to swap buffers</strong>. Plugins incompatibility will <strong>throw errors</strong>.

Let me tell you one thing. <strong>99% of what plugins do, Vim already do</strong>. Fast file exploration is native with netrw and wildmenu. Fast auto-completion is native with Omnicomplete. Spell checking is native. Why do you need NERDTree that just can't delete multiple files in same times ? Why do you need this stupid thing that make appear entertaining letters all around the screen to jump to another point ?

Keep in mind the dark side is everywhere. Before installing plugins, re-think of <strong>what you really need</strong>.
My personal idea is to just install syntax based configuration. Override Html syntax to Html5 updates. Build twig template handler. Change Php Omnicomplete function to fit with new ctags norms. Fix little things to remove useless spaces or preserve screen position on buffer swap and some other things. Upgrade native systems. Add nonexistent filetypes.

But the think is : I do not judge other Vimer that use lot of plugins cause this is the Vim philosophy. Using different tools, <strong>tools they need</strong>, the tools they choosed, the tools that make them <strong>gain times</strong>. But my personal recommendation is to preserve their Anakin Skywalker to the Darth Vader.
